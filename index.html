            <p class="text">This article is talking about how Shutterstock (a website to sell your own photos) is now allowing people to post their AI art and be given money for it. It also talks about if its right to let people post AI generated art as it is debated whether or not it is actually owned by the person who entered the prompt.</p>

                <p class="text">This article goes over how a crypto trading emipre has filed for bankruptcy. The company when for an evaluation of around $32 billion dollar to nothing due to the owner of the largest crypto exchange Binance. I believe that this was going to happen eventually as it always does to different crypto ventures and this one is not an execption. This also led Binance into a downwards spiral due to information about their internals being leaked out afterwards.</p>

                <p class="text">This article goes over the recent "show and tell" of Elon Musks company, Neurolink. It goes over how they are at a stage where they can use the chip that is implanted to use a mouse and type on a keyboard with their mind. This has also caused some controversies because Neurolink has been using animal subjects and one of the monkeys used in the experiments, passed away.</p>
